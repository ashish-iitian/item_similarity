# item_similarity

The goal of this project is to write a program that does the following:
1. Take some keywords as input and make a call to the eBay developer API to get a set of search results back for that keyword
2. For every item in the results, identify the item that is most similar (excluding the current item).
3. Print out every item id and its most similar item id, one pair per line, with a tab character separating the two ids.

There are two folders in here:
1. src_item_identical: contains my solution to pairwise-similar items' list printing part. 
2. src_search_related: contains the additional search-improvement part.

Inside each of the folders is an explanation of the work done.
