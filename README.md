# item_similarity
Used eBay search APIs to design a system that takes user keyword(s) as input and returns list of pairwise most similar items. Additionally, I also attempted to improve item-search by refining the initial keyword.

1. there are two folders in here 
2. src_item_identical: contains my solution to pairwise-similar items' list printing part. 
3. src_search_related: contains the additional search-improvement part.
